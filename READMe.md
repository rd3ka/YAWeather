The second YA application backed using vanila `JS` wrapper of [wttr](https://wttr.in), the right way to check the weather!

## Motivation
To strengthen the fundamentals of web development and web based technologies. Collaboration was also a core factor to consider since this project taught me to collaborate with other fellow developers.
>Huge shoutout to [Riya](https://www.github.com/buna26) for contributing weather specific codes to help map weather icon.

## Behind the Scene
For front end, this application uses  ![tailwind](screenshots/icons8-tailwindcss-16.png) tailwindcss. TailwindCSS makes styling easier and intuitive reducing the time it takes to write the front end. The backend uses vanilla JS for DOM manipulation. [wttr](https://wttr.in) is used to fetch weather data in JSON. Best part of wttr is that it has a huge list of weather properties in different formats w/o any API limitations or auth keys.

## Dependencies
If you want to add more feature and continue to develop. Please install these dependencies using npm. Node is a d-level dependency and should be installed 

```bash
npm -i tailwindcss 
```
In the package.json file add this line:
```json
"scripts": { 
"tailwind": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./build/css/style.css --watch"  
}
```
To compile tailwindcss into normal css:
```bash
npm run tailwind
```
